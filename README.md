# Rest-Api-Practice
REST APIs enable you to develop all kinds of web applications having all possible CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) operations.  REST guidelines suggest using a specific HTTP method on a particular type of call made to the server (though technically it is possible to violate this guideline, yet it is highly discouraged).
